The left plot shows the population dynamics of $D, R$ and $T$. The right plot compares estimates of the conjugation rate, assuming populations would be sampled at that point in time and the growth rates are known. Initially selected are $\gamma_{max}$ from the Simonsen end-point formula and $\gamma_{Dmax}$ based on the ASM end-point method. Dashed lines indicate the actual values of $\gamma_D$ and $\gamma_T$ (selected with the input sliders). 

The critical times $t_{c1}, t_{c2}, t_{c3}$ indicate the time points at which the assumptions underlying the ASM cease to be valid. To get an accurate estimate of the conjugation rate, one should ideally measure the mating populations before the minimal critical time. These critical times can be toggled on and off with the 'Display critical times' button. The end of the simulation is given by the 'measurement time'.
